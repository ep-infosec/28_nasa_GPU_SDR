GPU SDR
=======
<p>This project enable the readout of superconductive resonators using Ettus&reg USRP SDR platforms and Nvidia&reg GPUs. The goal of the project is to allow users to modify and customize every aspect of the data acquisition: from the realtime signal generation and demodulation to the analysis techniques.</p>

<p>This project has been developed and tested in various laboratories at JPL and Caltech in the context of the JPL Flexible radio-frequency readout for multiplexed submillimeter-wave detectors RT&D</p>

The documentation for this software is available at [this page](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~minutolo/gpu_sdr_doc.html)

Quickstart
----------
In order to test and use the system you need to:
  1. Gather all the required hardware: see the shopping list section section [here](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~minutolo/server_docs/build/html/dd/d8d/md_server_docs_01_installation.html)
  2. Compile the server using the instruction provided [here](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~minutolo/server_docs/build/html/dd/d8d/md_server_docs_01_installation.html)
  3. Launch examples of the python API or follow the quickstart guide [here](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~minutolo/lib_docs/lib_docs_index.html)
